# Week 2

**Status: NOT READY** 

 This page contains the code for the Data Analysis tutorial for this week so you can follow along with the videos. A set of challenges is presented at the end of each tutorial. These challenges count for the participation grade. 
 
 This is one of the six tutorials that counts towards the participation grade. It contains three questions. Handing in an acceptable answer to a question gives you 6 participation points. For more details on how the participation is grade is calculated, see Participation - Briefing (on Canvas).

**After you complete the tutorials:**
1. When you're ready, in Jupyter Lab, select File --> Export Notebook As --> Export Notebook to HTML. An html file will be generated (and probably downloaded to your Downloads folder). 
2. Upload this html file to Canvas.
