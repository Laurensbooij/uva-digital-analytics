# Week 2

**Status: READY** 

This page contains the code for the Data Analysis tutorial for this week so you can follow along with the videos. A set of challenges is presented at the end of each tutorial. These challenges count for the participation grade. 
 
**After you complete the tutorials:**
1. When you're ready, in Jupyter Lab, select File --> Export Notebook As --> Export Notebook to HTML. An html file will be generated (and probably downloaded to your Downloads folder). 
2. Upload this html file to Canvas.
