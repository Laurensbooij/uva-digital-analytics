    "# Challenges for week 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how Python and Jupyter Notebooks work and that you have read about Digital Analytics and Computational Social Science, it's time for you to combine apply this knowledge. This week has three challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each challenge has three components:\n",
    "1. **Programming**: Applying one of the programming or data analysis steps in Python you learned in the tutorial\n",
    "2. **Interpretation**: Explaining what you are doing and interpreting the results of the data analysis in MarkDown \n",
    "3. **Reflection**: Connecting these concepts with the literature of the week in a short reflection (*max 300 words*)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some important notes for the challenges:**\n",
    "1. These challenges are a warming up, and help you get ready for class. Make sure to give them a try on all of them. If you get an error message, try to troubleshoot it (using Google often helps). If all else fails, go to the next challenge (but make sure to hand it in).\n",
    "2. While we of course like when you get all the answers right, the important thing is to exercise and apply the knowledge. So we will still accept challenges that may not be complete, as long as we see enough effort *for each challenge*. The rubric (see Canvas) reflects this.\n",
    "3. Delivering the challenge on time on Canvas assignment is critical, as it helps also prepare for the DA live session. Check on Canvas how to hand it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facing issues? \n",
    "\n",
    "We are constantly monitoring the issues on the GitHub to help you out. Don't hesitate to log an issue there, explaining well what the problem is, showing the code you are using, and the error message you may be receiving. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** We are only monitoring the repository in weekdays, from 9.30 to 17.00. Issues logged after this time will most likely be answered the next day. This means you should now wait for our response before submitting a challenge :-)\n",

    "## Challenge 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out how to add (1) an image and (2) a link in a cell in MarkDown. You may need to search this online. Check how to do it, and include an image and a link in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a short text aimed at another student that does not know what MarkDown is, and explain step by step how they can add an image and a link in MarkDown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now working with Jupyter Notebooks and Python code - and submitting your notebook as html via Canvas. Review the article *van Atteveldt et al. (2019)* and explain how these activities relate to open science principles, and connect them to the Computational Science workflow. Motivate your response. "
