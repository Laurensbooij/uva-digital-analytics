# Week 1

 This page contains the code for the Data Analysis tutorial for this week so you can follow along with the videos. A set of challenges is presented at the end of each tutorial. These challenges count for the participation grade. 
 
 Each week delivered counts for 0.2 in the participation grade out of a maximum of 0.8. This means that you need to hand in 4 out of the 6 weekly challenges to get the full grade.

**After you complete the tutorials:**
1. Update your Private repository on GitHub with the Jupyter Notebook containing the answer to the challenges
2. Complete the Canvas Assignment for the week (informing the URL of the Jupyter Notebook in your private repository)
